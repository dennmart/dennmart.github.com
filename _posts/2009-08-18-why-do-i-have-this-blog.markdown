# {{ page.title }}

Lately, I've been doing a ton of experimentation on a variety of different programming stuff ([Python](http://www.python.org/), [CouchDB](http://couchdb.apache.org/) and [OAuth](http://oauth.net/), among others). It's been a blast to play around with different things, compare them to the current tools you use, and just be amazed when you do something incredible that came out of a simple idea from your mind.

Now, I don't know about anyone else, but my problem with this is that whenever I'm done experimenting with something and move on to another thing, my brain doesn't retain all this previous information I acquired. It's a bit frustrating when I return to some programming language that I used a month or two ago, and can only remember the very basic stuff. I'm sure this is a common problem with others, as well. It's a matter of exercising my mind. If you don't exercise your mind, it will definitely get flabby.

So, I decided to use this little space on the web as an online journal, so I can write down all the wonderful (and not-so-wonderful) things that I encounter while doing these experiments. Yeah, I already have a [blog](http://www.dennmart.com/), but I wanted something where I can dump some short thoughts on whatever I'm working with at the moment. I'll still keep my regular blog as a place to write down longer, more insightful posts.

Another reason why I wanted to do this is because it will be somewhat educational for me to look back a year from now at the things I've been doing and working on. After all, like Momma always said, "there's an awful lot you could tell about a person by their blog - where they're going, where they've been." I've written lots of blogs... Okay, so Forrest Gump's Momma didn't talk about blogs (I'm guessing they didn't have any blogs at the time in Greenbow, Alabama), but you should understand what I'm trying to say.

Finally, a huge thanks for this blog's existence goes out to the guys at [GitHub](http://github.com/) for their [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com), and to all the contributors to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for putting out an awesome and easy to use product to create sites like this one.

I'll be adding more soon, so keep an eye out for new changes!
