# {{ page.title }}

As I mentioned in my [initial post](http://development.dennmart.com/2009/08/19/why-do-i-have-this-blog.html), I'm using the awesomely cool [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/tree/master) site generator to bring you this blog. One of the nice things about Jekyll is that it allows the user to write their blog posts in any [markup language](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language) the tool supports. In reality, this all boils down to two choices: [Textile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Textile_%28markup_language%29) and [Markdown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

Just like any technology debates (Windows vs. Mac vs. Linux, emacs vs. vi, etc.), there are a lot of so-called 'religious debates' about Textile and Markdown, both with its loyal fans. Just doing a [quick Google search](http://www.google.com/search?q=textile+vs.+markdown) yields a lot of different forums where this discussion has played out.

I pondered for a few hours while setting up this blog, to decide which markup language I would use. Instead of blindly choosing one or the other, I tried both Textile and Markdown for my first blog post. I found that **Markdown** was the one for me. I found the finished Markdown post more readable than the Textile version (like links, headers, text formatting, etc.)

That doesn't mean I hate Textile, though. It's pretty awesome, too, and it's a hell of a lot better to write something for a blog or a wiki with Textile than HTML or nothing at all. I just decided to stick to Markdown (and its C-written Ruby implementation [rdiscount](http://github.com/rtomayko/rdiscount/tree/master)) for the time being.

In any case, choice is awesome.
